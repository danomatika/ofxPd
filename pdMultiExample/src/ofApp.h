// This example demonstrates how to use the libpd multiple instance support with
// the ofxPd C++ wrapper. When compiled with -DPDINSTANCE and -DPDTHREADS set in
// *both* CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, each ofxPd instance is separate with it's own
// internal state and message receivers. If the defines are not set, each ofxPd
// instance refers to the same libpd main instance.
//
// This example is adapted from the libpd pdtest_multi C example which is
// originally by Miller Puckette.
//
// *Do not* use this as your first approach to parallelize CPU hogging patches.
// It's highly suggested that you attempt to streamline your patches first before
// using this multiple instance support.
